# Classwork06_2D-Cube

Task:

1. Draw a 2D cube using midpoint line drawing or GL_LINES.
2. Rotate the cube 45 degrees with respect to the origin (no composite transformations needed) and draw the rotated cube

use rotation formulas:
- x'=x cos (theta) - y sin (theta)
- y'=x sin (theta) + y cos (theta)

there should be two cubes on the GL window; the initial one and one after the rotation.
