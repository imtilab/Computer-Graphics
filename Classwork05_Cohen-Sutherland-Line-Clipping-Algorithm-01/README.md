# Classwork05_Cohen-Sutherland-Line-Clipping-Algorithm-01

Process:

1. Generate 100 random numbers.
2. For a given window size (-.45, -.45 , .45, .45) compute region outcode.
3. Print the coordinate, outcode.
4. Draw the window as well.
5. Using Cohen Sutherland line clipping algorithm  only draw Fully accepted line (green color) and Fully rejected line ( red color).
